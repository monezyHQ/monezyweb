                    <p>
1. Editorial Content Disclaimer
Monezy (“the Platform”) provides condensed news summaries that are curated and rephrased by advanced artificial intelligence (AI) systems. These summaries are derived from publicly available information published by third-party media outlets (“Original Sources”) and are intended solely for informational, educational, and general awareness purposes.

While the Platform endeavors to maintain a high standard of editorial integrity and informational accuracy, the use of AI for rephrasing inherently introduces a risk of inadvertent errors, omissions, or interpretive deviations from the source material. Monezy expressly disclaims any warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of any content displayed.

Each summary provided is accompanied by a hyperlink directing users to the full version of the original article hosted by the Original Source. Users are strongly advised to consult the full article for comprehensive and authoritative information prior to forming any conclusions or taking any action.

Under no circumstances shall Monezy, its founders, employees, contractors, or affiliates be held liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages arising from the use of or reliance on the summarized content, nor shall the content be construed as investment advice, financial guidance, or a substitute for professional consultation.

2. Visual Content and Image Usage Disclaimer
The images, graphics, and other visual content (collectively, “Visual Assets”) utilized on the Monezy platform are sourced exclusively from:

Original creations by Monezy or its affiliates;

Public domain or openly licensed repositories; or

Reputable stock-image providers offering royalty-free, license-compliant media.

All Visual Assets are employed solely for aesthetic, illustrative, or thematic purposes. Unless explicitly stated, they do not purport to depict real persons, events, or scenes related to the accompanying editorial content.

The inclusion of any Visual Asset shall not be interpreted as an endorsement, affiliation, or factual representation. Monezy respects intellectual property rights and makes best efforts to verify the legitimacy and licensing of all images used. Should any content owner have concerns regarding image use, they are encouraged to contact us promptly at bharat@monezy.in for immediate review and resolution.

3. Sponsored Content and Advertising Disclosure
From time to time, Monezy may display advertisements or sponsored content, which shall be clearly marked as “Sponsored” or “Advertisement” within the platform. While such content is subject to Monezy’s internal vetting for relevance and compliance, all claims, representations, or endorsements made within sponsored content are the sole responsibility of the sponsoring party.

Monezy does not warrant, endorse, or assume any liability for the accuracy, legality, or efficacy of any sponsored material, and users are encouraged to exercise discretion and conduct their own due diligence before engaging with any advertised offerings or services.
